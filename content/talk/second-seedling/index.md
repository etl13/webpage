excerpt: "Clinical trials involving treatments for COVID-19 have shown varying levels
  of rigor and consistency, but very few studies have addressed the potential bias
  in estimating the treatment effect from these trials. A large body of literature
  have shown that including trials at risk in a network-meta analysis (NMA) could
  result in biased treatment effect estimates. Network meta-analysis combines multiple
  trials to create evidence about the comparative effectiveness of multiple treatments.
  In this presentation, we will introduce Bayesian bias-adjustment methods in NMA
  under contrast-based and arm-based frameworks to estimate bias-corrected treatment
  or high concerns using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Our method proposes a probabilistic
  model to incorporate uncertainty from studies given ‘some concerns’. We present
  an extensive simulation study to evaluate model performance and illustrate our methods
  using NMA of COVID-19 trials. The results present the impact of including studies
  with risk of bias in NMA and how they should be interpreted."
  effects. The risk of bias of a trial is classified into three groups: low, some,
