intro: "I have been working on my dissertation titled, Bayesian Hierarchical Models for the Combination of Data from Heterogeneous Sources. In general, harnessing information from multiple data sources is recognized for yielding more comprehensive and reliable results compared to relying solely on a single source. However, several key challenges arise in this process, including variability in quality of sources, missingness in key variables, and differences in populations of which each data set were sample. All three of my aims provide methods under the context of Bayesian Hierarchical modeling that address such key issues."
