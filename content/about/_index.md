title: "Hi there! Welcome."
description: "I'm a PhD Candidate advised by Dr. Hwanhee Hong in the Duke School of Medicine, Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics. I am interested in Bayesian hierarchical modeling in the regards to data integration, but more specifically utilized within comparative effectiveness research. While I work with combing data sources, the primary goal is to better understand and uncover health disparities that is limited through data availability. Simultaneously, I am interested in teaching and ultimately begin able to educate a new generation of statisticians."
